    <!-- <p id="intro">
        Artificial Intelligence has come a long way since its inception. From simple rule-based systems to today's complex neural networks, AI has evolved dramatically. This page explores the history, development, and key milestones in AI technology.

    <p class="default">
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a sophisticated branch of computer science dedicated to creating intelligent machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. At its core, AI systems work by processing massive amounts of data through complex algorithms, enabling them to recognize patterns, learn from experience, and make decisions. Unlike traditional computer programs that follow strict, predefined rules, AI systems can adapt to new situations, understand natural language, recognize images, and even generate creative solutions to problems. Modern AI comes in two main forms: Narrow AI (or Weak AI), which is designed for specific tasks like facial recognition or playing chess and is what we currently use in our daily lives, and General AI (or Strong AI), which would theoretically possess human-like consciousness and ability to perform any intellectual task but currently remains in the realm of science fiction. It's important to understand that despite common misconceptions fueled by science fiction and media portrayals, current AI systems don't possess emotions or consciousness - they are sophisticated tools that make decisions based on data patterns rather than human-like reasoning, and can only perform tasks they're specifically trained for. These systems represent a powerful tool that, when properly developed and implemented, can significantly enhance human capabilities across numerous fields, from healthcare to transportation to scientific research.
